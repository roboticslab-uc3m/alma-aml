Algebraic Machine Learning (AML) applied algoritms to humanoid robotics domestic tasks, focusing on the laundry pipeline, specifically on the tasks of:

- [ironing](ironing/)
- [folding](folding/)

This repository contains implementations of Algebraic Machine Learning (AML) algorithms applied to robotic tasks, specifically developed for the ALMA project. The focus is on exploring human-centric AML approaches as alternatives to complements to traditional learning methods.
